Possibly accumulated over several years but are you utilizing the full potential of this gold-like valuable asset? Unfortunately, the answer to this question is “no” for most businesses. We love trusting our gut feeling and make emotional decisions on an impulse. The adrenaline feels awesome until it doesn’t. Then problems start to surface where you never thought you’d have one. The management of the business becomes heavier and more such emotion-based decisions are added to the operations. Resources are stretched, employees are overworked and revenues are just not cutting it.\n\nSounds familiar? Let’s start from the correct and optimal utilization of your business data to make better business decisions. Look at problems as potential opportunities. Don’t know how to do that? That’s where Ima Solution steps in. Take the help of our business shrinks and data whisperers who are able to get to the core of even the most unique problems. Engage with Ima Solution to come up with logically sequenced business steps which are well-thought of and give you the peace of mind to confidently take the business ahead. Chat with a professional business consultant to get solutions, whether your problem is to set up a business unit, expand geographically or put out everyday business fires. <em>Ima Solution</em> is truly meant <em>for every business</em>.","Home","","inherit","closed","closed","","12-revision-v1","","","2019-01-09 07:21:51","2019-01-09 07:21:51","",12,"http://consulting-site.local/blog/12-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),

Possibly accumulated over several years but are you utilizing the full potential of this gold-like valuable asset? Unfortunately, the answer to this question is “no” for most businesses. We love trusting our gut feeling and make emotional decisions on an impulse. The adrenaline feels awesome until it doesn’t. Then problems start to surface where you never thought you’d have one. The management of the business becomes heavier and more such emotion-based decisions are added to the operations. Resources are stretched, employees are overworked and revenues are just not cutting it.\nSounds familiar? Let’s start from the correct and optimal utilization of your business data to make better business decisions. Look at problems as potential opportunities. Don’t know how to do that? That’s where Ima Solution steps in. Take the help of our business shrinks and data whisperers who are able to get to the core of even the most unique problems. Engage with Ima Solution to come up with logically sequenced business steps which are well-thought of and give you the peace of mind to confidently take the business ahead. Chat with a professional business consultant to get solutions, whether your problem is to set up a business unit, expand geographically or put out everyday business fires. <em>Ima Solution</em> is truly meant <em>for every business</em>.		\n								Moiz\n								General Manager\n								<ul>\n																																			</ul>\n			        				        		Moiz			        				        \n			        General Manager\n			<!-- /.team-item -->\n								Fatima\n								General Manager\n								<ul>\n																																			</ul>\n			        				        		Fatima			        				        \n			        General Manager\n			<!-- /.team-item -->","Home","","inherit","closed","closed","","12-revision-v1","","","2019-01-09 07:35:17","2019-01-09 07:35:17","",12,"http://consulting-site.local/blog/12-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),
